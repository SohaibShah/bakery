# How to Run the Application

1. Hi Fahad, first of all, open a terminal in the project folder by pressing `CTRL + ~ (The key under the escape button lol)` and run `cd server`
2. Then, run `npm run dev`. Your server is now running.
3. Now to run the front end, open another terminal in the project folder and run `cd client`.
4. Then, run `npm run dev`. Your client should now be running, and you can access it by going to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Where is your most prized database file??

Yeah, don't worry. It's now located under `/server/database.db`.

## I still have issues, because I'm stupid.

Yeah, I know. Give me a call.
